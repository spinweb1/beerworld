# Beer World

## Project setup

npm install


### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve


### Compiles and minifies for production

npm run build


### Design choices

I decided to use Vue.js to display the Punk API data for its
relative ease of use.  I also chose Materialize CSS for my CSS
framework. It is also easy to use and visually appealing.

### Ideas for future development

Ideas I have for further features include: adding search capability,
adding pagination, and more media queries to address non optimal layout.
Additional ideas might be a "like" feature, so users could weigh in
on their favorites, and a "details" page to display the considerable 
additional data included in the Punk API.
